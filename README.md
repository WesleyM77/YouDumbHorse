# YouDumbHorse

A [twitter bot](https://twitter.com/YouDumbHorse) that tweets a picture of John Mulaney saying "That's what I thought you'd say you dumb fucking horse" in reply to every new @realDonaldTrump tweet. This was deployed on a Raspberry Pi. This bot is now retired for two reasons: It stopped being funny and [@realDonaldTrump got banned](https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2020/suspension.html)! ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰
